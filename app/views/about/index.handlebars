                <h1>Climate Change: Do Humans Matter?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Climate change is real and it is happening right now. While the vast majority of scientists and politicians agree that the Earth cycles through natural changes in climate throughout time, the debate on the significance of anthropogenic (human) effects on climate change is at the center of a growing rift between the political and scientific communities. Scientists have compelling evidence that human interactions with the planet are indeed contributing to and compounding the natural climate cycles of the Earth. It is crucial that we work to create new distribution methods of this information so that the public can be informed and politicians can enact legislation to contain and control anthropogenic contributions to climate change.

                        The scientific community is always seeking new methods for content distribution in an effort to convey important climate information to as many user groups as possible. While some distribution media do currently exist, our project which will still be highly valued by anyone working in climate science. In addition to content distribution, this project will give users the opportunity to communicate with one another via a comment posting structure. The ability to start a dialogue between users is crucial to the advancement of the anthropogenic emission regulation agenda.

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        Using NASA climate simulation data from the Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS), we will create user-interactive visualizations that show how various diagnostic fluctuations (i.e. surface temperature, precipitation, etc.) change over time with and without regulations on anthropogenic emissions. Users will be able to specify which diagnostic to visualize, as well as toggle between anthropogenic regulation modes. In addition, users will have the ability to communicate via a comment posting structure.
